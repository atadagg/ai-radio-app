login process:
1. login with spotify
2. get the access token
3. cache it in the browser
4. send the access token to the backend

function process:
1. request current track data from spotify
2. scrape the duration of the song, progress_ms, track name, artist name, album name()
3. substract the progress from the duration
4. set a timer for the remaining time
5. send the track data to chat gpt api
6. get the response from chat gpt api 
7. send the response to front-end
8. front-end uses text to speech api to play the response
9. Wait for the timer to finish.
10. when the timer is done, repeat the whole process


problems:
1. user stops the music unexpectedly(solution: if the song is the same song as the previous song, then don't do anything)
2. user skips the song
3. chat gpt is really slow
2. I don't know how to set a timer for the remaining time
3. I don't know how to send the track data to chat gpt api
4. I don't know how to use text to speech api to play the response
5. money(solution:if the user listens to the a song from the database play the response from our database instead of generating a new one)
